# Synth sETH Integration Guide

## Purpose
To show how to use the token in practice — via code, DeFi pools, wallets, and third-party protocols.  
This document is intended for **developer integrators and users** who want to interact with the token via code, wallets, or DeFi applications.

---

## 1. Overview
The token is fully **ERC-20 compatible** and suitable for DeFi.  

**Typical use cases:**  
- **DEXs** (Decentralized Exchanges)

> Future integrations such as lending, yield farming, or bridges may be added as the ecosystem develops.

---

## 2. Ethers.js Usage Examples

### Connect to the contract
```js
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// Example provider (Infura, Alchemy, etc.)
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID");
const signer = provider.getSigner();

// ABI should be generated from the contract source code or obtained from Etherscan
const abi = [ /* ABI here */ ];

const sETH = new ethers.Contract(
  "0xF119ADa773624761108A12bc20503B2195727061",
  abi,
  signer
);
```

### Get token balance
```js
const balance = await sETH.balanceOf("0xYourWallet");
console.log("Balance:", ethers.formatUnits(balance, 18));
Transfer tokens
js
const tx = await sETH.connect(signer).transfer(
  "0xRecipient",
  ethers.parseUnits("10", 18)
);
await tx.wait();
console.log("Sent 10 sETH");
```
### Integration Use Cases
Integration	Example
DEX	Create a WETH/sETH pool on Uniswap

Other integrations such as lending, yield farming, and bridges may be added in the future.

### ABI Reference
The full ABI can be generated from the contract source code or obtained from the verified contract on Etherscan:

Contract Address: [0xF119ADa773624761108A12bc20503B2195727061](https://chatgpt.com/c/68f258e4-60c0-8328-bb60-45c41965cdef#:~:text=Contract%20Address%3A-,0xF119ADa773624761108A12bc20503B2195727061,-ABI%20Location%3A)

The ABI is required to interact with the contract using scripts, wallets, or other applications.

### Post-Deployment Actions
Add the token to MetaMask (Add Token → Custom → Contract Address)

Create a WETH/sETH pool on Uniswap

Optionally, lock or manage initial liquidity via a trusted service (e.g., Team Finance or Unicrypt)
