## Overview

**Synth sETH (sETH)** is a standard ERC20 utility token deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It operates with a fixed, unchangeable total supply, ensuring no new tokens can ever be created.

The primary use case of sETH is to function as a liquid asset within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Its value is established and maintained through its trading pair with Wrapped Ether (WETH) on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. This mechanism allows sETH to serve as a straightforward and transparent representation of Ethereum's value, suitable for various DeFi applications and trading strategies.
