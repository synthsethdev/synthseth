# Token Synth sETH (sETH)

![Logo](logo.png)

---

## Overview

**Synth sETH (sETH)** is a verified ERC-20 utility token deployed on the Ethereum mainnet.  
It operates with a **fixed, immutable total supply**, ensuring no additional minting or inflation over time.

The primary use case of **sETH** is to serve as a **liquid synthetic representation of Ethereum (ETH)** within the DeFi ecosystem.  
Its value is established through the **WETH/sETH pair** on decentralized exchanges such as **Uniswap**, providing transparent and market-driven price discovery.

## 1. Vision

To provide a **foundational, no-frills utility token** that enhances liquidity and composability in the Ethereum DeFi space.

**Problem:**  
The DeFi landscape is saturated with complex tokenomics‚Äîrebasing, taxes, reflections, and inflationary mechanisms.  
While innovative, they often introduce barriers to integration and reduce predictability.

**Solution:**  
sETH focuses on **simplicity and reliability**.  
A clean, minimal ERC20 implementation ensures:
- Predictable behavior and gas efficiency,  
- Seamless integration with all major wallets and protocols,  
- Trustless operation without admin control or upgradeability.

## 2. Tokenomics & Distribution

| Allocation | Percentage | Amount (sETH) | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Community & Ecosystem Growth** | 90% | 90,000,000 | Strategic partnerships, liquidity incentives, marketing, and community grants |
| **Initial Liquidity** | 5% | 5,000,000 | Creation of the initial WETH/sETH pool on Uniswap |
| **Team & Development** | 5% | 5,000,000 | Team allocation under vesting schedule to ensure long-term alignment |

## 4. Syntheth DAO

**Syntheth DAO** is a decentralized governance community that oversees the evolution of the **Syntheth ecosystem** and the **sETH token**.  
DAO members collectively decide on protocol upgrades, treasury allocation, and strategic integrations, ensuring that the project remains **community-driven and transparent**.

The DAO operates through a **Gnosis Safe multisignature wallet** and voting on **Snapshot**, providing trustless governance.

### DAO Treasury

The official treasury is the Gnosis Safe wallet:  
**[0x0EEcea0A472EB4419bFf9D572cC4A906c80734e3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0EEcea0A472EB4419bFf9D572cC4A906c80734e3)**  

All operations require multisignature approval from the assigned admins.  
The treasury will be used for:
- Funding protocol development and integrations  
- Covering operational and marketing expenses  
- Supporting community initiatives  

### 4.1 First Proposal: Approve DAO Treasury
